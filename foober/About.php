			<h1>Origin Story</h1>
			<p>Like many companies, Project House has taken on many forms and definitions. All of them have stemmed from the desire to encourage individuals to take control of their lives. At first the idea was for a "hostel for adults," complete with the tools and reliability necessary for digital nomads. Then it was a property owner/workshop leader collaboration tool for people to travel and learn from eachother in a shared setting. Then it became a social networking and resource tool for digital nomads. And now, it is a ever evolving conglomeration of all these ideas. 
			</p>
			<h1>Founder</h1>
			<p>Project House was created by Jeff Hartline, an ex-Googler and avid world explorer. Jeff left Google after feeling like despite being a powerful company, he would have more ability to help the world on his own. When he is not trying to help people, he is working his creative muscles on his multi-media story based on his characters Mémé and Mesus. Or he is playing Ultimate Frisbee.
