<p><strong>When:</strong> 2 - 6 October, 2017.

</p><p><strong>Who:</strong> Jeff, Niki, Taylor, Ezra, Jacqueline, Marissa, Johann, Manuela, Daniel, Mariana, Gizelle, and David.

</p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Carlos E Restrepo, Medellín, Colombia.

</p><p>We found Ezra, Jacqueline, and Marissa on workaway.org, where budget travelers can volunteer their time at local projects. We were looking for a few random but energetic contributors to form the core workforce of Project House II, and that was exactly what they were! Additional participants we found through local connections, Manuela and Johann from Venezuela, and Daniel and Mariana from Colombia.

</p><p>When you have only four days to work on something, you have to get started very quickly! We presented the group with 5 project possibilities, four extending prior Project House work and one open-ended technical challenge. The group decided to merge Lindsay’s “workshop business” with the crowd-funding expertise needs of Vic’s local project, they decided to develop a crowdfunding workshop and pilot it with Vic’s colleagues Gizelle and David.

</p><p>For two days we put our heads down to research various aspects of crowd-funding wisdom, then brought it all together into a presentation deck. We reviewed the deck ourselves, then invited over Gizelle and David. We pitched our workshop, and asked for feedback… what was most relevant to them, what was least relevant, what did they most need help on?
</p><p>G &amp D were very enthusiastic about the information and resources we presented them. However, they thought the most valuable workshop to them would be a detailed technical program on one of the pieces of a successful crowdfunding campaign -- wordsmithery, image selection, pitch video, social media advertising.

</p><p>For the final day of Project House II, G &amp nd D came back with their media drive. Gizelle paired up with Ezra and Marissa to the find the best media for their charity-oriented crowdfunding campaign. Jeff and Jacqueline worked with David on a 30 second project pitch, a critical ingredient to successful campaigns. Niki shared visual designs to help G &amp D explain their sport to casual investors. (See final recording here!)

</p><p>We packed up shop the next day to head on our second Colombian excursion: a weekend in Bogotá and cabin camping in Cucuy national park.

</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong>
</p><ul><li>Culinary: Johann’s home-made empanadas at Project House dinner.
<li>Culture: Colombian nationals in Bogotá, Vic, G & D’s team finish 5th!
<li>Tourism: Cucuy National Park.</ul>

<p><strong>When:</strong> 1 - 30 September, 2017.

</p><p><strong>Who:</strong> Jeff, Niki, Lindsay.

</p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Carlos E Restrepo, Medellín, Colombia.

</p><p>Project House is about getting people excited learning by doing whatever it is that interests them. Lindsay contacted us about Anywhere Digs while we were two thirds through with Focus Week Sudamerica. We pitched Project House, and proposed Medellín, Colombia. Colombia boasts sub-$200 RT fare from the US, easy to understand Spanish, and the delightful absense of Escobar-era problems. It’s also really cheap, by gringo standards, at least if your able to avoid the gringo traps. Watch out!

</p><p>Lindsay came to Medellîn interested in expanding her marketing skills, and looking for ways to leverage those skills to earn a living while travelling. We found she had a knack for connecting with other entrepreneurs, local and nomadic. Lindsay started exploring a workshop-based business model for digital nomads. She began demo-ing a brand workshop, leveraging entrepreneurial contacts and digital nomad facebook groups, as well as ads.facebook.com. Both of Lindsay’s brand workshops were full, and had rave client feedback!

</p><p>What other workshops could we run? What could we charge for a workshop? Where should we look for paying clients? Rather than pondering these questions twiddling our thumbs, we decided to just try some other workshops, and explore some schedules, pricing, and advertising channels. But running a workshop requires knowing material. We took a week exploring easy-to-learn video editors before settling on iPhone’s oSnap, and then pilotted an oSnap workshop with our friend Vic, a local contact. Vic runs an organization that organizes team sport opportunities for at-risk youth in suburban Medellín, and used oSnap and our cardboard stage to “snap” a promo video demo-ing his sport.

</p><p>Lindsay decided the video workshop was ready, and ran two more video workshops for her last week at Project House. (More discussion of workshop project execution, deliverables and lessons can be found ((elsewhere)).)

</p><p>Meanwhile, Jeff and Niki were drafting designs on another “digital nomad” product, nicknamed LIA, or language immersion assistant. LIA synthesized usability ideas we’d developed on the ground during Focus Week Sudamerica. By end-of-week, Project House had launched its first app on Android’s App Store, the beta ((ImmersionAssistantPrototype))!... And could start testing it ourselves on the streets, cabs, and cafes of Medellín.

</p><p>To celebrate the conclusion of the first Project House, we spent some tourist time photographing grafiti at Comuna 13 and hiking up a huge hill at Guatapi.

</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong>
</p><ul><li>Culinary: Carmen in Poblado.
</li><li>Culture: Festival de la cultura y libros.
</li><li>Tourism: Medellín Streetart.

</p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Palermo, Buenos Aires, Argentina ... and elsewhere!

</p><p>Our first tour of South America focused on a two month co-working experiment in Palermo, a trendy but earthy neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Outside of Bs.As., we shared co-live-work time between 23 cities in 5 South American countries. We wanted to try different living styles, standards, and compare local costs of short-, mid- and longer-term alternatives, as well as evaluate regional tourism and digital connectivity.
</p><p>Participants worked mostly on their own, with occasional collaboration. Each person had their own projects and development interests, and unique travel curiosities to satisfy.

</p><p><strong>Highlights:</strong>
</p><ul><li>Culinary: Argentinian asada
</li><li>Culture: frisbee clinics in La Plata, Argentina, and Vina del Mar, Chile.
</li><li>Tourism: Patagonia glaciar-scapes, swimming the Galapagos.</ul>
