		  <p>Project House is a cross-cultural, multi-disciplinary, transnational community. We are everywhere we can be, questioning everything we can, imagineering our way beyond the broken status quo. We are teachers and learners. We are dreamers and doers. We tackle challenges by building solutions, one step at a time.</p>

Your group will brainstorm solutions to the problem, then work towards a self-determined set of deliverables to evaluate your solution. Deliverables can be: a website, an application, mockups, a video, a prototype, a market study, a crowd-funding campaign, a business plan.</p>
