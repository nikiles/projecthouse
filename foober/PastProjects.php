				<h1>Crowd-Funding Toolkit Workshop</h1>
			</div>


			<div class="ProjectDescription">
				<p>It seems everybody these days wants to work and travel, and many want to do something meaningful in their professional lives not just pay the bills. It should not be surprising, then, that two different self-led Project House groups iterated on a business model for remote workshops -- a locally impactful way for digital nomads to earn a living while developing and sharing their expertise.</p>
<!-- While in Medellin, Colombia, Project House ran a workshop that worked on creating a crowdfunding campaign for a local Ultimate Frisbee group that was doing outreach to at-risk youth in a town 6 hours away. From this workshop a crowd-funding toolkit was made to be used by other grassroots group hoping to gain support through crowd-funding platforms. --!>

				<h1>Language Immersion App - LIA</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="ProjectDescription">
				<p>One problem that arises when learning a new language is that native speakings speak too quickly for the learner to understand. LIA is a simple app that works with a smartphone and headphones with a microphone. The user record, playback, and repeat audio at a selection of speeds and volumes.</p>

				<p>Using the hardware buttons on the phone users don't need to look at their phone to operate the app. They can start, replay, and slow down snippets of audio to help them understand the conversation around them.</p>

                                <p>There are few modern atrocities as frustrating as the QWERTY keyboard wedged into the bottom third of a palm-sized touch screen. YQWERT iterates on fun and crazy prototypes that leverage 21st century technology to challenge QWERTYâ€™s seemingly eternal dominance. Did you know? <a href="https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/buzzword/entries/QWERTY-phenomenon.html">QWERTY phenomenom:</a> the tendency to use the first available system despite the fact that new ideas could provide better alternatives.</p>

                                <p>Spending time in different countries is non-stop exposure to stagnant inequalities and the systematic undermining of ethical globalization. These inequalities are well-hidden from those not fortunate enough, in time, money, or professional flexibility, to explore countries far from where they work. A shared vision of the global reality is critical to soliciting a community response. Whose Shoes is an infographic in game-form, that aims to facilitate transnational perspective.</p>
